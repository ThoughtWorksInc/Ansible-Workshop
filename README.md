ansible-dojo
============

Before the Dojo:
- Install ansible (via brew, yum, whatever you use)
- Clone this repo: ```https://git.realestate.com.au/dhall/ansible-dojo```
- Then in the Vagrantfile uncomment/comment out the box definitions to choose the OS you wish to use
- Type ```vagrant up```

If this fails don't worry, the images will have been downloaded for the Dojo which will save time at the beginning.
