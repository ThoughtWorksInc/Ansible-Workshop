ansible-dojo
============

Before the Dojo:
- Install ansible (via brew, yum, whatever you use)
- Clone this repo: ```git@github.com:ThoughtWorksInc/Ansible-Workshop.git```
- Then in the Vagrantfile uncomment/comment out the box definitions to choose the OS you wish to use
- Type ```vagrant up```

Make sure you spin up the virtual box before you take part in the dojo.
